1.DATA TYPES & VARIABLES 

SYNTAX: 

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    cout<<a<<endl;
    char b = 'a';
    cout<<b<<endl;
    float c = 1.2;
    cout<<c<<endl;
    double d = 1.23;
    cout<<d<<endl;
   int size = sizeof(a);
    cout<<size<<endl;
    
    
}
